You will need to use the python module citidata.py. When DD.citi files are obtained from the VNA, use the python program data_analysis.py to print out the array
of real and imaginary numbers. From here you can use this array to plot graphs.

The equation for log magnitude as seen on the VNA is 20*log10(sqrt(Re^2+lm^2)) where Re are the real numbers and lm are the imaginary numbers.

To get the S parameters you will need to take 10**(Log Mag). The you can plot your SE equations.
